## 📝 WORKFLOW DETAILS

| Workflow Name | Workflow ID | Export Filename |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|

## 🔑 CREDENTIALS TO DOCUMENT

**What to note for each credential:**
- Credential name (e.g., "DraggonnB-Supabase")
- Credential type (e.g., "HTTP Header Auth")
- What it connects to (e.g., Supabase, Anthropic, LinkedIn)

**DO NOT copy actual API keys/secrets** - just document the names and types.

---

## 📸 SCREENSHOTS NEEDED

1. Dashboard showing all 3 workflows
2. Workflow 1 editor (showing nodes)
3. Workflow 2 editor (showing nodes)
4. Workflow 3 editor (showing nodes)
5. Credentials page (Settings → Credentials)

---

## 🚨 IF WORKFLOWS DON'T EXIST

**Stop and tell me immediately.**

This is Critical Blocker #2. If workflows are missing:
- We need to rebuild (16-40 hours)
- OR hire expert (R2,000-R5,000)
- OR simplify MVP (remove automation)

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You're done when:**
- 3 JSON files in Templates/N8N_Configs/
- CREDENTIALS_LIST.txt created
- Screenshots folder has 4-5 images
- All JSON files are valid (open in text editor)
- Each JSON file is > 1 KB (not empty)

**Then:** Message me "Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2"

---

## 🆘 NEED HELP?

**Can't find workflows?** → Check workspace/organization dropdown (top left)
**Can't export?** → Try: Menu (3 dots) → Download/Export
**Export is empty?** → Try different browser or disable extensions
**Forgot password?** → Use "Forgot password" link

**Stuck?** → Take screenshot and message me!

## ⏭️ NEXT STEPS AFTER EXPORT

Phase 2: Setup N8N on Hostinger VPS (1-2 hours)
Phase 3: Import workflows to VPS (30-60 mins)
Phase 4: Test & switch over (3-5 days monitoring)

**Total migration time:** 2-4 hours work + 3-5 days testing
