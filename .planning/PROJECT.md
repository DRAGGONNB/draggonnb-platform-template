# DraggonnB OS -- AI-Powered Business Operating System

## What This Is

A production-deployed multi-tenant B2B operating system targeting South African SMEs. DraggonnB OS provides CRM, email marketing, AI content generation, social media automation, accommodation management with full AI automation, AI agents, analytics, and payments -- all in one platform. All clients share a single Supabase project with RLS-based tenant isolation. Each client gets a subdomain on *.draggonnb.online with DB-backed module gating.

## Core Value

**A complete, working multi-tenant business automation platform where new clients are provisioned with a database row, a subdomain, and activated modules -- live in under an hour.** Every module works: CRM, email, content, payments, dashboard, accommodation (with AI automation, guest portal, channel manager, cost tracking), AI agents.

## Architecture

- **Multi-tenant:** Shared Supabase DB with RLS policies using `get_user_org_id()` (STABLE, cached per-query)
- **Auth model:** `organization_users` junction table links auth users to `organizations`. `user_profiles` for display info. `getUserOrg()` in `lib/auth/get-user-org.ts` is the central auth function (used by 19+ files)
- **Routing:** Wildcard DNS on `*.draggonnb.online`, middleware resolves tenant from subdomain, injects `x-tenant-id`/`x-tenant-tier`/`x-tenant-modules` headers
- **Module gating:** `module_registry` (global catalog) + `tenant_modules` (per-tenant activation) tables
- **Provisioning:** 9-step saga: create-org -> create-admin -> assign-subdomain -> seed-data -> n8n-webhooks -> deploy-automations -> onboarding-sequence -> qa-checks -> configure-billing. Rollback cascades via `DELETE FROM organizations WHERE id = ...`
- **AI ops:** N8N for deterministic automation, Claude API via BaseAgent for intelligent ops, build-time Claude Code
- **Event-driven automation:** `emitBookingEvent()` dispatcher triggers automation rules, guest messages, staff notifications, and auto-cost entries on booking status changes

## Current Milestone: v3.0 — Commercial Launch

**Goal:** Transform feature-complete platform into revenue-ready product with modular pricing, Easy/Advanced UX, and embedded vertical finance. Target first paying client within 2 weeks; 25 paying SA SME clients in 6 months.

**Target capabilities:**
- Modular pricing: R599 Core (Marketing + CRM + Social) + R1,199 Vertical (Accommodation / F&B / Lodges) + add-ons (Finance-AI R399, Events R299, white-label R499) + R1,499 one-off setup fee + published overage pricing
- Per-page Easy/Advanced toggle — every module lands on AI-action-card "Easy view" with "Advanced view →" link
- Shared `<ModuleHome>` component reused across Campaigns, Email Sequences, CRM, Accommodation, Restaurant, Finance
- Full landing + pricing site redesign with interactive module picker
- Brand voice capture onboarding wizard injected into all AI generation via Anthropic prompt caching
- Campaign Studio MVP (Holo-equivalent): intent → multi-channel AI-drafted campaign → approve → auto-schedule
- Usage caps + overage billing + per-client cost monitoring dashboard (protects unit economics)
- Embedded finance in Accommodation + Restaurant (VDJ accounting knowledge productized — SA tourism VAT, SARS day-end, owner-payout statements, tax-ready exports)
- Finance-AI add-on: Telegram receipt OCR → categorize → export ledger
- 3-day automated onboarding pipeline (provision → brand voice capture → kickoff call → first campaign → live)

**Design principle:** South African SMEs prefer simple, quick solutions. Every module lands on Easy mode by default. Advanced mode is opt-in for power users. "It just works" beats "it has every feature."

**Phases 09–12 roadmap** (to be generated by gsd-roadmapper):
- Phase 09: Pricing model + site redesign foundation
- Phase 10: Brand voice + ModuleHome + Campaign Studio MVP + first client go-live
- Phase 11: Margin safeguards + 3-day onboarding automation
- Phase 12: Easy views platform-wide + embedded vertical finance + Finance-AI add-on

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** Next.js 14, Supabase, TailwindCSS, TypeScript -- locked
- **Payment:** PayFast only (SA market requirement)
- **Currency:** ZAR (South African Rand)
- **Hosting:** Vercel for app, Hostinger VPS for N8N
- **Compliance:** POPI Act (SA data protection) -- RLS-based tenant isolation
- **AI:** Claude API via N8N workflows + BaseAgent for per-call ops
