# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Complete multi-tenant B2B operating system for South African SMEs. Shared Supabase DB with RLS-based tenant isolation, wildcard subdomain routing, DB-backed module gating, automated provisioning.
**Current focus:** Accommodation module at ~75% implementation. 39 DB tables live, 36 API routes, 8 UI pages. Billing module added. Ready for first accommodation client test.

## Current Position

Phase: Accommodation module implementation (Waves 0-3)
Plan: v1 roadmap complete (7/7 phases). BOS v2 complete. Accommodation module 75% implemented.
Status: DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION. Live at https://draggonnb-mvp.vercel.app
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Session 29: Accommodation module full implementation
Progress: 39 DB tables + RLS live in Supabase. 36 API routes (30 new + 6 standardized). 4 new frontend pages + sidebar nav updated. Pushed to GitHub, Vercel deploy triggered.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Shared DB + RLS multi-tenant (replaces per-client Supabase isolation)
- Single Vercel deployment with wildcard subdomain routing (*.draggonnb.co.za)
- DB-backed module registry + tenant_modules for feature gating
- Hierarchical CLAUDE.md: root + 3 sub-directory build specs (agents, provisioning, API)
- Error catalogue as JSON knowledge base (.planning/errors/catalogue.json)
- No autonomous sub-agents per client until 20+ clients
- Ops dashboard tables designed but deferred until 5+ clients
- Brand identity: reverted to original dark charcoal theme with blue/purple accents
- Landing page: dark charcoal background (original design)
- Sidebar: emoji icons with blue active states (original design), branded "DraggonnB OS"
- AI Agents surfaced as dedicated sidebar section (Autopilot, AI Workflows, Agent Settings)
- Protected pages use inline error states (never redirect to /login) to prevent redirect loops
- `getUserOrg()` uses admin client fallback for RLS bypass + auto-creates missing user records
- Supabase service role key rotated (2026-03-05) after accidental exposure

### What Was Built (Session 26 -- 2026-03-01)

**Dashboard & CRM Redesign (6 pages):**
- Dashboard home: professional B2B overview with stat cards, quick actions, pipeline summary, module status, usage bars
- CRM overview: stat cards linking to sub-pages, pipeline bar chart (recharts), recent contacts/deals tables
- Contacts: professional data table with search/filter, status badges, 8 mock SA contacts
- Companies: data table with industry filter, deals value, 8 mock SA companies
- Deals: Kanban board with 6 pipeline stages, 12 mock deals, summary stats
- New component: CRMPipelineChart (recharts BarChart)

**Brand Color Rebrand (all pages):**
- CSS: --primary from dark blue to brand-crimson (348 75% 42%)
- All accent colors: blue -> brand-crimson, purple -> brand-charcoal
- Pipeline chart qualified bar: blue -> crimson
- Kept semantic colors: green=money/success, amber=content/gold

**Sidebar Rewrite:**
- All emoji icons replaced with Lucide React icons
- Logo area: image + "DRAGGONNB Operating System" branding
- Active nav: brand-crimson-50 bg + crimson-500 border
- Added AI Agents nav section: Autopilot, AI Workflows, Agent Settings

**Header Rewrite:**
- "+ New" button, avatar, search focus all brand-crimson
- Added AI Agents breadcrumb routes

**Landing Page Light Theme (5 files):**
- Full conversion from dark charcoal-900 to white/gray-50 light theme
- Nav with logo image + "DRAGGONNB OS" branding
- White cards, crimson accents, light backgrounds
- CTA section kept dark for contrast
- Footer branding: "CRMM" -> "OS"

### Pending Todos

- Save actual DraggonnB logo as public/logo.png and update src in nav.tsx + Sidebar.tsx
- Apply migration 08_ops_dashboard.sql to Supabase (when managing 5+ clients)
- Configure PayFast passphrase and production mode
- Configure Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials
- Configure Resend API key for email delivery
- First end-to-end provisioning test with real client config
- Accommodation: Add deposit policies API, email templates API, comms timeline API
- Accommodation: Guest portal with access pack system
- Accommodation: Channel manager integration (Booking.com, Airbnb sync)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Actual logo PNG file needs to be saved to public/logo.png
- Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials still needed
- PayFast passphrase still needed
- Resend API key still needed

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-05 (Session 29)
Stopped at: Accommodation module implementation complete (Waves 0-3). All changes pushed to GitHub, Vercel deploy triggered.
Resume with: Verify Vercel build. Test accommodation flows (create property -> unit -> rate plan -> booking). First provisioning test.

### Session 29 Summary (2026-03-05)
**What was accomplished:**
1. Applied accommodation DB migrations to Supabase (06_accommodation_core.sql, 07_accommodation_rls.sql)
   - Fixed FK references: `REFERENCES users(id)` -> `REFERENCES auth.users(id)` (7 occurrences)
   - Fixed RLS pattern: subquery -> `get_user_org_id()` for consistency
   - 39 tables live with RLS policies enabled
2. Built 30 new API routes across 5 parallel streams:
   - Pricing: rate-plans, rate-plan-prices, discount-rules, additional-fees, cancellation-policies
   - Bookings: bookings, booking-segments, charge-line-items, bookings/cancel
   - Payments: payments
   - Operations: tasks, issues, readiness
   - Guest: guests/[id], waivers, service-catalog, addon-orders
3. Standardized 6 existing API routes with getAccommodationAuth() + Zod validation
4. Built 4 new frontend pages:
   - Bookings list (status filters, search, quick actions, inline create)
   - Property detail (tabs: Units, Rates, Settings, Images)
   - Calendar grid (14-day availability view, color-coded bookings)
   - Operations dashboard (tasks board, issues, unit readiness traffic light)
5. Updated sidebar navigation: added Bookings, Calendar, Operations links
6. TypeScript build check: zero accommodation-related errors
7. Merged with upstream changes (billing module, tests, onboarding wizard)

### Session 28 Summary (2026-03-05)
**What was accomplished:**
1. Fixed 4 live bugs: signup org linking, missing user auto-create, dashboard blank page, CRM redirect loop
2. Root cause: `redirect('/login')` in pages created infinite loop with middleware (both redirecting authenticated users)
3. Root cause: RLS blocked anon client from querying/creating user records; fixed with `createAdminClient()` bypass
4. Added 59 component render tests (dashboard, CRM, autopilot, sidebar, template editor) -- total 241 tests passing
5. Rebranded sidebar from "POWER CRM" to "DraggonnB OS"
6. Added error boundaries (`error.tsx`) for dashboard and CRM routes
7. Added `/api/auth/signout` route for error state "Sign Out & Retry" links
