# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** A complete, working end-to-end business automation platform that can be cloned and deployed for a new client within 48-72 hours.
**Current focus:** Production credentials configured. Social OAuth + PayFast passphrase remaining.

## Current Position

Phase: ALL 7 PHASES COMPLETE + v2 Evolution + Audit fixes + DB migrations + Dashboard fixes
Plan: 16/16 plans complete + all migrations applied to Supabase
Status: DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION. Live at https://draggonnb-mvp.vercel.app
Last activity: 2026-02-10 -- Session 23: Production credentials configured (PayFast, Resend, Supabase service role)
Progress: [████████████] 100% COMPLETE (social OAuth + PayFast passphrase remaining)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key architectural decisions:
- Brownfield project: ~60% of code existed, phases focused on fixing/completing
- Security first: RLS, signup flow, middleware fixed before feature work
- Admin client pattern: `lib/supabase/admin.ts` for webhooks (not service role in server.ts)
- Vitest over Jest (10-20x faster, better ESM support)
- N8N on VPS (Cloud access lost), shared between CML and DraggonnB
- Gitea on VPS as central state store (code on GitHub, state on Gitea)
- Centralized feature gating: `lib/tier/feature-gate.ts` for all usage checks and limits

### Pending Todos

- Configure PayFast passphrase (from PayFast dashboard)
- Switch PAYFAST_MODE from sandbox to production (when ready for real payments)
- Configure Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials (for social posting)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Facebook App ID/Secret not yet configured (OAuth flow ready, needs credentials)
- LinkedIn Client ID/Secret not yet configured (OAuth flow ready, needs credentials)
- PayFast passphrase not yet provided (merchant ID + key configured)
- N8N workflows deployed and active on VPS -- content generator tested end-to-end with GPT-4o

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-10 (Session 23)
Stopped at: PayFast + Resend + Supabase service role + email tracking credentials configured in .env.local and Vercel.
Resume with: PayFast passphrase, switch to production mode, Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials.

### Session 23 Summary (2026-02-10)
**What was accomplished:**
1. Production credentials configured:
   - PayFast: Merchant ID (32705333) + Merchant Key set in .env.local and Vercel
   - Resend: API key configured in .env.local and Vercel
   - Supabase: Service role key added to Vercel production env
   - Email tracking: SECRET added to Vercel production env
2. Vercel now has 12 production env vars (was missing 5 critical ones)
3. VPS Gitea sync automated: created sync-gitea-state.sh script
4. STATE.md updated to reflect credentials progress

**Still needed:**
- PayFast passphrase (from PayFast dashboard)
- PAYFAST_MODE switch to production (when ready)
- Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials

### Session 22 Summary (2026-02-10)
**What was accomplished:**
1. Dashboard fixes:
   - Fixed all queries to use correct DB column names (posts_published, ai_generations_count, stage)
   - Analytics chart now reads from platform_breakdown JSONB column
   - Replaced hardcoded fake usage/trends with real data + context-aware empty states
   - Sidebar now shows real usage stats from client_usage_metrics
   - Upgrade Plan button links to /pricing
2. +New button (header):
   - Made functional with dropdown menu (New Contact, New Deal, New Campaign, Generate Content)
   - Added dynamic breadcrumbs based on current route
3. CRM navigation fixed:
   - Created missing `companies` table in Supabase (CRM page depended on it)
   - Created missing `platform_metrics` table (dashboard top posts depended on it)
4. Security hardening (Supabase):
   - Fixed search_path on 5 functions (capture_lead, provision_client, get_media_stats, increment_media_usage, update_media_updated_at)
   - Converted 3 SECURITY DEFINER views to SECURITY INVOKER (dbe_lead_pipeline, dbe_client_overview, dbe_dashboard_metrics)
   - Security advisor now clean: only INFO-level items remain (intentional service-role-only tables)
5. All 41 tests still passing, no new TypeScript errors
6. State synced to Gitea VPS (platform-crmm repo)

**Git commits this session:**
- `332c0f3` chore: update state for session 22 (dashboard/CRM/security fixes)
- `3420348` fix: dashboard data queries, +New dropdown, CRM navigation
- `aae845d` chore: update state after Supabase migrations applied
- `cb0560b` fix: resolve audit issues, complete Phase 3+4, wire N8N integration

**Uncommitted changes:** None -- all work committed

**Supabase migrations this session:**
- `create_companies_and_platform_metrics` (companies + platform_metrics tables + RLS)
- `fix_function_search_paths_v2` (5 functions with SET search_path = public)
- `fix_security_definer_views` (3 views converted to SECURITY INVOKER)

**What to do next session:**
1. Configure Resend API key (RESEND_API_KEY in .env.local + Vercel)
2. Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .env.local and Vercel env vars
3. Add EMAIL_TRACKING_SECRET to .env.local
4. Configure PayFast production merchant credentials
5. Configure Facebook/LinkedIn OAuth credentials
6. Test full user flow end-to-end on production (signup -> dashboard -> CRM -> content)

**Key decisions:**
- Dashboard queries fixed to match actual DB schema (column names differed from code assumptions)
- Missing tables (companies, platform_metrics) created rather than removing code references
- SECURITY DEFINER views converted to SECURITY INVOKER for proper RLS enforcement

**Blockers/concerns:**
- Vercel MCP not connecting (Streamable HTTP error) -- deploy works via GitHub auto-deploy
- Supabase MCP tokens expire frequently -- need re-auth each session
- Gitea DNS doesn't resolve from Windows dev machine -- use SSH + localhost:3030

### Previous Sessions
- Session 21 (2026-02-09): Audit fixes + Supabase migrations (RLS, accommodation, RPC)
- Session 20 (2026-02-08): Cleanup (git, Vercel, GitHub sync)
- Sessions 1-19: All 7 phases built + v2 evolution plan
