# DraggonnB OS - Operating System

## Multi-Client Architecture

All clients share a single Supabase project with RLS-based tenant isolation. Each client gets provisioned with:
- An organization row in the shared DB (with subdomain, tier, and modules)
- A subdomain on `*.draggonnb.co.za` (wildcard DNS + Vercel wildcard domain)
- Activated modules via `tenant_modules` table (DB-backed feature gating)
- N8N workflows (cloned from template workflows in `n8n/`)

Client-specific config lives in `tenant_modules.config` JSONB column. The `module_registry` table is the global catalog of available modules. Middleware resolves tenant context from subdomain on every request and injects it via headers (`x-tenant-id`, `x-tenant-tier`, `x-tenant-modules`).

RLS policies use `get_user_org_id()` function (STABLE, cached per-query) for fast tenant isolation. All tables have `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` enabled.

## Multi-Step Migration Discipline (OPS-05)

DraggonnB OS runs on a single shared Supabase database. Migrations must never break existing rows or running deployments. Follow this 4-step pattern for any column or constraint change:

1. **Add column NULLABLE.** Ship a migration that ADDs the column with no NOT NULL constraint. Existing rows have NULL.
2. **Deploy code that writes the column.** New rows populate the column. Old rows still NULL.
3. **Backfill old rows.** Either via a one-shot SQL UPDATE (if data is derivable) or via a script that runs once per org. Verify backfill complete via `SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE column IS NULL`.
4. **Add NOT NULL in a later migration.** Only when step 3 confirms zero NULLs.

**Never combine** "add column" + "add constraint" in a single migration on a populated table. The constraint will fail mid-deploy and Supabase will mark the migration failed without rollback.

**Other rules:**
- One change per migration. Never bundle (e.g., add 2 columns + new table + RLS policies).
- Test against a Supabase branch before applying to main.
- Migrations are append-only — never edit a committed migration file. Always create a new one.
- RLS policy changes go in their own migrations, never alongside DDL.

**Reference:** See PITFALL-12 in `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` for the full failure-mode analysis.

## Role Definitions

- **Claude Code** = Execution hub. Implements all code changes, provisions clients, manages infrastructure, syncs state. Full access: VPS (SSH), GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, N8N. Everything goes through Claude Code for implementation. No exceptions.
- **OpenClaw** = Advisory/ideation layer. Reads Gitea repos (platform-crmm, ops-hub), STATE.md, error catalogue. Suggests improvements, patterns, proposals. CANNOT execute anything, modify code, or access client Supabase instances.
- **Chris** = Decision maker and approval gate. Bridges ideation to execution. Approves provisioning, reviews proposals.

## File Discipline

- Only update files that are DIRECTLY related to the current task
- State files (STATE.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md) update ONLY after work is done -- never speculative
- No unnecessary documentation, comments, or README files unless explicitly requested
- No emoji in code or docs unless requested
- Keep state files concise -- facts, not narrative

## Source of Truth

- **Code:** GitHub (`DRAGGONNB/draggonnb-platform`, main branch)
- **State/Docs:** Gitea VPS (`draggonnb/platform-crmm` at git.draggonnb.online)
- **Infra:** Gitea VPS (`draggonnb/ops-hub`)
- **Deploy:** Vercel (`draggonnb-platform` — live at draggonnb-platform.vercel.app)
- **Workflows:** N8N on VPS (`n8n.srv1114684.hstgr.cloud`)
- **Errors:** `.planning/errors/catalogue.json` (local + synced to Gitea)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14.2.33 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Supabase (DB + Auth), Resend (email), PayFast (payments), N8N (workflows)
- Vercel (hosting), GitHub (code), Gitea (state docs)

## Session Open Protocol

1. Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context and last session summary
2. Read `.planning/errors/catalogue.json` for recent errors and patterns
3. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted work from previous session
4. Identify current phase/milestone from STATE.md
5. Report findings before starting new work

## Session Close Protocol

1. Scan session for errors encountered (build failures, runtime errors, API errors)
2. Append new errors to `.planning/errors/catalogue.json` with timestamp, category, root_cause, resolution, and file_path
3. Check for recurring patterns: if 3+ errors share the same root_cause, add a pattern entry to `.planning/errors/patterns.md`
   - If 3+ errors share the same source/category combination, create or update a pattern entry in `.planning/errors/patterns.md` with prevention steps.
4. Update `.planning/STATE.md` with session summary (what was done, blockers, next steps)
5. Push state files to Gitea `draggonnb/platform-crmm` via API (see Gitea Sync Protocol)
6. Include `errors/catalogue.json` in the Gitea sync file list
7. If a Vercel deploy happened during the session, check build logs for errors and capture any failures

## Gitea Sync Protocol

After completing work that changes project state:
1. Update local `.planning/STATE.md` with what was done
2. Push updated state files to Gitea `draggonnb/platform-crmm` via API
3. If infrastructure changed, update `draggonnb/ops-hub/infrastructure.md`
4. Files to sync: STATE.md (always), ROADMAP.md (if changed), PROJECT.md (if changed), errors/catalogue.json (if errors captured)

## VPS Access

- SSH: `ssh hostinger-vps` (key auth, no password)
- Gitea API token: stored in Claude Code memory
- Gitea container IP: resolve via `docker inspect root-gitea-1`
- Gitea host port: 3030 (not 3000)

## Module Manifest

Module catalog lives in the `module_registry` table (Supabase). Per-tenant activation in `tenant_modules` table. Legacy `scripts/provisioning/template/client-config.json` retained for reference but DB is source of truth. Available modules: crm, email, social, content_studio, accommodation, ai_agents, analytics. Each module maps to route prefixes, DB tables, and tier requirements.

Provisioning flow (9 steps): create-org -> create-admin -> assign-subdomain -> seed-data -> n8n-webhooks -> deploy-automations -> onboarding-sequence -> qa-checks -> configure-billing. Rollback cascades via `DELETE FROM organizations WHERE id = ...`.

## Accommodation Automation Layer

The accommodation module includes a full AI Automation & Operations Layer (5 phases, all complete):

| Phase | Scope | Key Files |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1: Guest Comms | Event dispatcher + message queue + multi-channel sending | `lib/accommodation/events/dispatcher.ts`, `lib/accommodation/events/sender.ts` |
| 2: Payments | PayFast link generation + payment tracking + financial snapshots | `lib/accommodation/payments/payfast-link.ts` |
| 3: Staff Ops | Telegram ops bot + task assignments + department channels | `lib/accommodation/telegram/ops-bot.ts` |
| 4: AI Agents | 4 agents (quoter, concierge, reviewer, pricer) extending BaseAgent | `lib/accommodation/agents/*.ts` |
| 5: Costing | Per-unit cost tracking + stock inventory + profitability reports | Auto-cost in `dispatcher.ts` |

**DB tables:** 84 total. **API routes:** 162 total (102 accommodation + 60 other modules).

The event dispatcher (`emitBookingEvent()`) is the central integration point -- booking status changes trigger automation rules, guest messages, staff Telegram notifications, and auto-cost entries.

**Supabase joined query pattern:** Supabase TypeScript types infer joined data as arrays. For many-to-one joins, cast through unknown: `(data.joined_table as unknown as { field: Type } | null)?.field`

## Sub-Directory Build Specs

Three sub-directory CLAUDE.md files provide build specs for extending the platform:

- **`lib/agents/CLAUDE.md`** -- How to build new AI agents (extending BaseAgent, type registration, session storage)
- **`lib/provisioning/CLAUDE.md`** -- How to add provisioning steps (saga pattern, rollback, config validation)
- **`app/api/CLAUDE.md`** -- How to build API routes (auth patterns, validation, error responses, feature gating)

## AI Operations Architecture

| Layer | Tool | Scope | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| Deterministic ops | N8N workflows (cron, webhooks) | Per-client automation | Near-zero |
| Intelligent ops | Claude API via BaseAgent | Per-call, tracked in agent_sessions | Per-call |
| Build-time AI | Claude Code (this tool) | Per-session, developer time | Per-session |
| Advisory | OpenClaw (read-only Gitea) | Strategic suggestions | Existing |

No autonomous sub-agents per client until 20+ clients with proven patterns. Current agents: LeadQualifierAgent, ProposalGeneratorAgent, QuoterAgent, ConciergeAgent, ReviewerAgent, PricerAgent. Future: Anthropic Agent SDK when scale justifies it.

## Auth & User Record Pattern

Protected pages call `getUserOrg()` from `lib/auth/get-user-org.ts`. This function:
1. Gets authenticated user via `supabase.auth.getUser()`
2. Queries `organization_users` junction table with `organizations` join (tries user client, then admin client for RLS bypass)
3. Gets display name from `user_profiles` table
4. Auto-creates missing records via `ensureUserRecord()` using `createAdminClient()` (service role) if rows are missing
5. Returns `{ data: UserOrg, error }` -- never redirects, never throws

**Key tables:** `organization_users` (junction: user_id + organization_id + role), `user_profiles` (display info), `organizations` (tenant data). There is NO standalone `users` table -- auth users link to orgs via the junction table.

Pages render inline error states (not redirects) when `getUserOrg()` fails. This prevents redirect loops with middleware. Error boundaries (`error.tsx`) catch unexpected throws.

## Testing

241 tests (Vitest). Test config in `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment for `__tests__/components/**`.
- Unit tests: security, API routes, agents, tier gating
- Component render tests: dashboard, CRM, autopilot, sidebar, template editor
- Integration tests: dashboard data flow, user/org auto-creation
- Libraries: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`

## Build Reviewer

Invoke the build reviewer agent (`.claude/agents/build-reviewer.md`) after provisioning or before deployment. Runs pre-flight checklist: DB security, deployment health, integration connectivity, feature gating, error catalogue cross-reference.

## GSD Framework

This project uses the GSD framework for planning and execution.
- Plans live in `.planning/phases/`
- Use `/gsd:*` commands for phase management
